# [Arcade-Game Project: P.A.L. Game](https://jadenf.itch.io/pal-game)
- During time as a summer camp counselor, I taught the second grade about video game development by allowing them to create their own Police Athletic League (P.A.L) game.<br/>
- The game was a simple Mario-style platformer that was pieced together with the kids' ideas.<br/>
- Drake's song 'Kiki Do You Love Me' (clean version!) was used once you won due to the kids' persistence.
