# JadenF_Portfolio
<p>These projects outline what I have learned and applied throughout my college career; Containing work in media design, video game production, documentation, and 2D/3D modeling.</p>


# [Arcade-Game Project: Life & Death](https://jadenf.itch.io/life-death)
- Used Construct 3 to program a top-down story game that utilized an art style not commonly used in the program.<br/>
- Produced multiple forms of documentation that described the team's goals, projected milestone dates, presentations, and progress reports.<br/>
- Spent personal time to learn Consruct 3 in depth in order to meet the goals of the project<br/>
- Results were a "short yet successful game unlike anything made in the course" as quoted by the professor.<br/>

# [Arcade-Game Project: P.A.L. Game](https://jadenf.itch.io/pal-game)
- During my time as a summer camp counselor, I taught the second grade how game development works by allowing them to create their own Police Athletic League (P.A.L) game.<br/>
- The game was a simple Mario-style platformer that I pieced together with the kids' ideas.<br/>

# 3D Game Project: Tank Shot
- Worked in Blender 2019 to design all assets and models for a 3D third-person tank shooter game based in Unity.<br/>
- Designed models of the player's tank, along with six varients of tank barrels and ammo to match.<br/>
- Created two extra assets, a dog tag collectible and a target for gameplay testing.<br/>
- Play tested the game multiple times before releasing the final product.<br/>

# Game Project: Space Traders and Raiders
- Given a large 20 page video game document by the professor that the class was expected to understand, then to create the game properly.<br/>
- Tasked with creating 16-bit characters and four map markers.<br/>
- Designed the basic version of the team's "company logo" that was later improved.<br/>

# Documentation Project: User Manual for Blender 2019
- Studied Blender 2019 to grasp a deeper understanding in order to create a 25-page user manual.<br/>
- Manual described Blender's tools and their basic functionalities.<br/>
- Incorporated a chapter that teaches the reader how to make a low-poly world using many of the tools outlined in the manual.<br/>
- Described how to import and export files in Blender.<br/>
- Included a title page, index, and glossary.<br/>
