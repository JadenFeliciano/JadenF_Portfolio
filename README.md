<h1>PORTFOLIO</h1>
<p>My portfolio showcases the many kinds of designs and art I've created through my lifetime. This includes all of my game development projects, 2D/3D models, and even all of my documentation through college.</p>

</h1># Arcade-Game Project: Life & Death</h1>
<p>- Used Construct 3 to program a top-down story game that utilized an art style not commonly used in the program.
- Produced multiple forms of documentation that described the team's goals, projected milestone dates, presentations, and progress reports.
- Spent personal time to learn Consruct 3 in depth in order to meet the goals of the project
- Results were a "short yet successful game unlike anything made in the course" as quoted by the professor.</p>

<h1># Arcade-Game Project: P.A.L. Game</h1>
<p>- During my time as a summer camp counselor, I taught the second grade how game development works by allowing them to create their own Police Athletic League (P.A.L) game.
- The game was a simple Mario-style platformer that I pieced together with the kids' ideas.</p> 

<h1># 3D Game Project: Tank Shot</h1>
<p>- Worked in Blender 2019 to design all assets and models for a 3D third-person tank shooter game based in Unity.
- Designed models of the player's tank, along with six varients of tank barrels and ammo to match.
- Created two extra assets, a dog tag collectible and a target for gameplay testing.
- Play tested the game multiple times before releasing the final product.<p>

<h1># Game Project: Space Traders and Raiders</h1>
<p>- Given a large 20 page video game document by the professor that the class was expected to understand, then to create the game properly.
- Tasked with creating 16-bit characters and four map markers.
- Designed the basic version of the team's "company logo" that was later improved.</p>

<h1># Documentation Project: Blender 2019</h1>
<p>- Studied Blender 2019 to grasp a deeper understanding in order to create a 25-page user manual.
- Manual described Blender's tools and their basic functionalities.
- Incorporated a chapter that teaches the reader how to make a low-poly world using many of the tools outlined in the manual.
- Described how to import and export files in Blender.
- Included a title page, index, and glossary.</p>
